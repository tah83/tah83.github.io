Its nice to have easy drop and use code without having to go into header and hardware specific configurations. This project is an attempt to abstract the configuration for the one wire protocol.
One Wire protocol is less popular? I've seen it implemented as a hardware protocol in a few micro controllers, but it isn't common like I2C, SPI, UART... so it needs to be implemented as a software protocol, the specified timing and communications needs to be handled by the processor.
