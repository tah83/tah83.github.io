Transferring to a two layer PCB, and getting the two layers to line up right can be a pain. If its not right, through hole parts might not line up right.
   
I've seen a few methods that seem like the hard way. Cutting the layers and PCB to very specific sizes and matching up corners or guide points.

This is a visual way to match up the layers. All that's needed is a bright light source, and a clean clear glass sheet elevated about the light source. Here I use some white LED's and a glass sheet salvaged from a printer/scanner.
